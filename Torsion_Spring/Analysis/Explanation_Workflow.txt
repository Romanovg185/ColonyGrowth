Image Generation:
In order to generate an image, you run Export_Image.sh. 
This shellscript generates an image at the first timestep where you have 500 or more particles, then 1000 and more, etc.
If the image does not look right, for example showing thin white lines spanning the image, please use Matplotlib 2.0.2 or newer.
These images can then be analyzed using the the following ImageJ Macros:
- Whitespace.ijm to determine the packing fraction
- EllipticalFit.ijm to determine the ellipticity of the colony

Data Generation:
Since many analyses take a long time, we use pickling to allow us to do this on the cluster as well.
Pickling allows us to store the analysis results in .p files, which can be easily read into Python for displaying.
These six Analyze_Data_* files are called by running the shellscript called Make_Pickles.
This shellscript uses the files in the Analyze_Colony package to generate pickles (.p files)
It reads files in the format
These are then read by the files in the Unpickle folder
